**GSU DSA** is a static educational website designed specifically to support **Georgia State University** students taking CSC 2720 / Data Structures. 

I'm a former student of **Dr. Islam**, and thus this project was created as an interactive supplement to his CS 2720 curriculum, though it should largely apply to other professors' curriculums as well.

## Overview

Data structures are one of the most important concepts of computer science, especially in technical interviews, yet they can be difficult to grasp through the code implementation alone. As a previous student who has taken **Dr. Islam's** course, I built this tool to help current **GSU Data Structures** students visualize each concept because I also faced difficulty trying to imagine how these structures looked beyond their Python implementation.

This project offers visualizations for the standard structures and algorithms covered in class, providing real-time feedback for operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal to reinforce understanding before exams. I also took inspiration from
old PlayStation homescreens for the navigation for some nostalgic eye candy.

## Preview

### Example usage for Heaps

*Users can switch between min/max via the toggle.*

### Example usage for Topological Sorting

*Users can draw their own graph or use a preset.*

## Current Structures

The application currently supports visualizations for the following data structures:

### Linear Structures

* **Stack:** Visualize LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) operations
* **Queue:** Visualize FIFO (First-In, First-Out) operations
* **Linked Lists:**
* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List



### Key-Value Stores

* **Dictionary:** Key-value mapping visualizations.
* **Hash Table:** Demonstrate collision resolution and hashing functions.

### Trees

* **Binary Tree:** Standard binary tree traversal and structure.
* **Heaps:** Max-Heap and Min-Heap operations (heapify, extract).
* **AVL Tree:** Self-balancing binary search tree rotations.
* **Trie:** String storage and retrieval.

### Graphs & Algorithms

* **Graph Traversals:** Visual representations of nodes and edges + their respective adj. list/matrix representations.
* **Topological Sort:** Visualizes dependency resolution and ordering for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
* **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** A weighted graph builder that visualizes the shortest path discovery process, generating a dynamic distance table and highlighting the final path.

## Missing Structures/Concepts

These structures have not been implemented in the site as of yet, nor has their implementation been planned, though ontributions are welcome!

* **Low-Level Array**
* **Referential/Dynamic Array**
* **Deque**
* **Circularly Linked Lists**
* **Any sorting**
