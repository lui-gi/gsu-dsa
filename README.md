# GSU DSA

**GSU DSA** is a static educational website designed specifically to support **Georgia State University** students taking CS 2720 / Data Structures. I'm a former student of **Dr. Islam**, and thus this project aims to provide a clear and interactive supplement to his CS 2720 curriculum.

## Overview

Data structures are one of the most important concepts of computer science, especially in technical interviews, yet they can be difficult to grasp through the code implementation alone. As a previous student who has taken Dr. Islam's course, I built this tool to help current GSU Data Structures students visualize each concept so you can make more sense of each structure.

This project offers visualizations for the standard structures and algorithms covered in class, providing real-time feedback for operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal to reinforce understanding before exams. I also took inspiration from
old PlayStation homescreens for the navigation for some eye candy.

## Current Structures

The application currently supports visualizations for the following data structures:

### Linear Structures

* **Stack:** Visualize LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) operations (`push`, `pop`).
* **Queue:** Visualize FIFO (First-In, First-Out) operations (`enqueue`, `dequeue`).
* **Linked Lists:**
* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List



### Key-Value Stores

* **Dictionary:** Key-value mapping visualizations.
* **Hash Table:** Demonstrate collision resolution and hashing functions.

### Trees

* **Binary Tree:** Standard binary tree traversal and structure.
* **Heaps:** Max-Heap and Min-Heap operations (heapify, extract).
* **AVL Tree:** Self-balancing binary search tree rotations.
* **Trie (Prefix Tree):** String storage and retrieval optimization.

### Graphs & Algorithms

* **Graph Traversals:** Visual representations of nodes and edges.
* **Topological Sort:** Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) ordering.
* **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Shortest path visualization.
